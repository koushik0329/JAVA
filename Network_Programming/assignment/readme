Consider the Socket programming code we discussed in Week 4. Review the lecture and do your research to convert the traditional socket communication into an SSL-encrypted one. What you need to do is to tune the existing client and server code to use SSL Sockets for exchanging messages over the network. Once you are able to do that, verify using the Wireshark network sniffer (https://www.wireshark.org/Links to an external site.) that all the communication between the client and server is encrypted and no plaintext is showing in the exchanged packets. For simplicity, you can test the client and server code on the local host (same computer) and use the 127.0.0.1 IP address for connecting to the server. Submit a Word or PDF report: (1) demonstrating your code, (2) showing the steps needed to compile and run it, (3) any security configuration you needed to do, and (4) how does Wireshark view the packets in the encrypted state.
You can work in groups of two members max. All group members should submit the same report to secure a grade in the Canvas grade center.
